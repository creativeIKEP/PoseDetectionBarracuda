PoseDetectionBarracuda is a human pose detecter that runs the [Mediapipe Pose](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose) Detection neural network model on the [Unity Barracuda](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@latest).

PoseDetectionBarracuda implementation is inspired by [BlazePalmBarracuda](https://github.com/keijiro/BlazePalmBarracuda) and I referenced [his](https://github.com/keijiro) source code.(Thanks, [keijiro](https://github.com/keijiro)!).

## ONNX Model
The ONNX model files have been converted for Unity Barracuda from Mediapipe's ["pose_detection.tflite"](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/0.8.3.2/mediapipe/modules/pose_detection/pose_detection.tflite) file.
The conversion operation is the same as [FaceLandmarkBarracuda](https://github.com/keijiro/FaceLandmarkBarracuda) by [keijiro](https://github.com/keijiro).
Check [his operation script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C6zEB3__gcHEWnWRm-b4jIA0srA1gkyq?usp=sharing) for details.
